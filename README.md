5. Clean Code Development: Clean code is a reader-focused development style that produces software that's easy to write, read and maintain.
     - Using docstrings: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L22)
     - Error handing & exception: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L34)
     - indention code: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L9)
     - meaningful variable + method name: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L64)
     - Import all libaries on the top: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L1)

6. Build Management: Build management is a critical aspect of modern software development, especially with the adoption of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices. It involves collecting, compiling, testing, and deploying software assets to facilitate the release process.

   **build.py** - Generated files : (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/tree/main/HigherStudy/reports) and (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/build.py)
   
   **setup.py**: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/setup.py) and (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/tree/main/HigherStudy/Higher.egg-info)
   
   **pyproject.toml**: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/pyproject.toml)

8. Continuous Delivery: Continuous Delivery is a software development method that automatically builds, tests, and prepares code changes for a production release .

9. Unit Test: In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

10. IDE: I have used VS code. My favourite shortcuts:

     1. Ctrl + Shift + C to copy document
     2. Ctrl + Alt+ N - commit
     3. Ctrl + - for toggle the terminal
  
10: DSL: A Domain Specific Language is a programming language with a higher level of abstraction optimized for a specific class of problems. A DSL uses the concepts and rules from the field or domain.
    The link of DSL: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/dsl.py)

11. Functional Programming:
      - 1. Higher order functions: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L55)
      - 2. Function as return : (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L59)
      - 3. Higher order function: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L71)
      - 4. Function as parameter : (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L75)
      - 5. Mostly side effect free function: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L16),     (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L34)
      - 6. Anonymous Functions: (https://github.com/SanjidaKohinurOni/ASE/blob/main/HigherStudy/project/model.py#L43)
